The application is superb, we tried finding restaurants and places to visit, in small villages, towns, suburbs and the database they have is incredible, if you are traveling to a new place or to another country the app is highly recommended.

The Foursquare Missions summs it up nicely:

Explore the world, find cool things, leave tips about them to guide others.

FourSquare even has an algorithm that identifies your tastes and linking over time and suggests what might interest you wherever you go.

We started exploring the city useing the application,

we started our journey at the highly congested wholesale market of itwari in nagpur.
The application was telling me that there were 20 coffee shops, 17 restaurents and 35 pubs plus 3 malls movie theaters and even an arcade gaming joint in the 30 km radius, inspite of living in the city for 25yrs we really didn't know the city had so much to offer.

In the tips section we found all sorts of tips like which restaurents are good what to eat where to go and what to do once you go there, it was like a tour guide with just about everything in the know

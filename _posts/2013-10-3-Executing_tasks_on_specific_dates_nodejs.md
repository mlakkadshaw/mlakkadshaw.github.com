Sometimes you want to execute task after certain interval, I am not talking about executing a task after every 5 minutes, but after certain days; say every Monday at 5pm more like corn jobs.

If you are looking for a library which allows you to execute arbitrary  functions at specific dates, so you're in luck because an awesome Node.js library called [node-schedule](https://github.com/mattpat/node-schedule) allows you do just that.

Head over to [Github repo](https://github.com/mattpat/node-schedule), and read about it in detail and get started.

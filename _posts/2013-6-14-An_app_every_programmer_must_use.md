title: An app which every programmer must use
---
As a programmer I want be constantly updated with technologies/programming  languages I uses, I wanted to read tutorials, tips and best practices and wanted to know about new tools and frameworks that are coming, and for that I was constantly asking about best blogs about Technology-X, and people use to ask me about what are the best Python blogs or what are the best ruby on rails blogs and what's the best IDE for java development etc.

But there is no solution available to get all this information in one place, so I thought of developing one: I call it [Ken](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammedlakkadshaw.ken&hl=en).

It is an Android app which keeps you updated with the latest programming news, you have to select your interests e.g: Node, Python, Javascript, Android etc. and it will show you all the latest news related to these technologies.

Ken is tool which I needed badly and I think a lot of other people can benefit from it, so if you are having the same problem which I had: [Try Ken](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammedlakkadshaw.ken&hl=en)

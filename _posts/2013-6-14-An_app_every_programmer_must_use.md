title: An app every programmer must use
---

As a programmer I want be constantly updated with technologies/programming  languages I use, **I want to read tutorials, tips, best practices** and wanted to **know about new tools and frameworks that are coming**, and for that I was constantly asking people about best blogs / websites about Technology-X, and I was also very often bombarded with the questions like: *What are the best Python blogs?* or *What are the best ruby on rails blogs?* and *What's the best IDE for java development?* etc.

But there is no solution available to get all this information in one place, so I thought of developing one: I call it [Ken](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammedlakkadshaw.ken&hl=en).

It is an Android app which keeps you updated with the latest programming news, you have to select your interests e.g: Node, Python, Javascript, Android etc. and it will show you all the latest news related to these technologies.

Ken is tool which I needed badly and I think a lot of other people can benefit from it, so if you are having the same problem which I had: [Try Ken](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammedlakkadshaw.ken&hl=en)

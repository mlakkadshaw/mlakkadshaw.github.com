Title: The Waterfall Model
layout: post
---

This is a sequential Design model in which the flow is downward, there is no upward flow in this model, the diffrent phases of waterfall model are as follow:
	
	Problem Definition
			Analysis
				Design
					Coding
						Testing
							Maintainance 

As you see in the above representation there is no upward flow, the next phase begin only after the current phase is finished.

### Analysis:
This phase it to analysis client requirement and gather requirements and understand them.
When the client requirement is clearly understood by the client and the development and the business requirement document is prepared then only the next phase begins.

### Design:
After the requirement specification are prepared the system specification is defined, and software planning and the architecture of the software is defined in this phase.

The software is divided into modules and then those large modules are then again subdivided into smaller modules and a logical relationship among the modules is established.

The user interfaces are designed and the how the overall system will work is agreed upon  by the developer and is explained to all the stakeholders.

### Coding:
Here actual code for the software is written, this phase is also called ad the implementation phase, in this phase the software specification is converted into actual software by coding.

### Testing:
When the entire code for the software is written then this phase beings, in this phase test are conduction of the software like Unit testing, Integration Testing, User Acceptance testing.
When entier codebase of the software is prepared then only this phase begins.

### Maintenance:
Here the software is deployed on the client side and actually business is run on the software.
The regular maintenance of the software of takes place in this phase.

### Advantages of waterfall model
* Provide robust documentation
* Faults are detected early

### Disadvantages 
* Not at all flexible: Requirements cannot be changes later
* Huge time is wasted 
* Testing comes quite late, and hence the bug cannot be fixed.
* Does not offers parallel development.
